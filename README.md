## Introduction

Internet Not Found was inspired by my own home internet consistantly going out on me and being subjected to the [dinosaur game](https://trex-runner.com/) nearly every day. While the project is incomplete it does showcase my ability to deploy on firebase and heroku, create custom routes in Ruby on Rails, and organize components, styling, and custom hooks in React. 

## Technologies

* Front-End : React.js
* Back-End: Ruby on Rails
